In order to run the app you need to open 2 git windows and go to the hunters-web-app/api & hunters-web-app/client.

After that type "yarn start" on both of them and press enter.

A browser window should open(it may take a while to load)

You can log in by using (john@gmail.com/123456) or register a new user

All the user's information is saved on a cloud database(MongoDB)

You can log off by clicking the top left "HunterSocial" button

In case the site stops working you can restart node.js by going to the api git window and typing "rs" this will restart the server

You can stop both git windows from running by pressing ctrl+C
